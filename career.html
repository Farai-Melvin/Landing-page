    <h2>Web Dev</h2>
    <p>
      This is actually one of the projects I'll be adding to my portfolio. Yes, a website about my journey is not really something that can be used by anyone since it's basically a blog about me, but it showcases my skills.
      They may be unpolished, but within a year by the time of the 8 week internship I'm sure I'll have achieved a lot. For me this is basically uni at home.
      I tend to spend more time on this actually since I feel I have a larger gap to catch up on, but people who've never dabbled in computer science tend to career switch to web dev or even software engineering so I believe I can do it.

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>
      My plan is to start freelancing by August at most. Using Fiverr and Upwork, I hope to be earning the minimum wage or at least half that. Once I reach that point I'll begin investing in this. Bootcamps and proper accredited certificates like ones from the Open University.
      Not a degree, but a solid goal in my opinion. December I should be able to get into a small time job relating to all this. That's if all  goes well and I don't encounter hurdles that are too high for me to get over, which is unlikely... for now. All I have to do is invest as much time as a typical university student, which is around 8 hours daily, leading up to 35 hours tops a week.
      Difficult in a home setting yes, but I really don't have a choice or a reason to not invest that.
