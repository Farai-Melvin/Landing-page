    <h2>Scholarships</h2>
    <p>
      Typically, you need to have been accepted into a university or already be enrolled in one to even begin applying (it's a very common requirement).
      So applying for scholarships isn't as easy as I'd want it to be.
      It is for Masters Degrees yes, but for undergraduate ones it is not.
      You can check using bachelorsportal.com if you don't believe me. Tons of scholarships, few with relatively lax requirements, almost none that don't require enrolment.
      This isn't saying I haven't found any, I've applied to a couple, most of them via their website submission form.
      It's not that they are difficult to find, my case just isn't your typical one.
    </p>
    <h2>University</h2>

    <h3>Application Process</h3>
    <p>
      Amongst others, I'm applying to Canadian universities, specifically the ones in Ontario since they were the first ones I could find that had one application Hub to make it easier to apply.
      By easier to apply I mean using one central account to access every application. This ensures that I'm aware of all my applications, their progress and the requirements using one platform.
      I'll still apply individually to promising universities but that'll mean having multiple accounts for one application. From what I've been experiencing, applications aren't as straightforward as we'd all expect: Apply, choose a course and send documents.
      It is true for some universities like Wits, but for these abroad ones you need an account for the application portal, another for the University's website and another for the registration (which you'll use once, to be able to register for the portal).
      I don't mind this to be honest, but I just want to be smart and maintain a good bird's eye view over what I'm doing, lest I forget passwords (yes, passwords usually have to be different) and the accounts as a whole.
    </p>

    <h3>Application fees</h3>
    <p>
      Using a hub seems cleaner since it's usually one payment for all the choices, and the price is averaged. For OUAC it's 125 CAD, which is around Â£67 for each application. The maximum number of universities I can apply to is 5.
    </p>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p>
      What I'm doing is basically grasping at thin air. I don't know where to start (or didn't), and now that I have a starting point, the requirements are setting me back. It's absurdly easy for citizens to get them regardless of grades (within reason of course).
      Internationally, not really. Without the backing of a college helping you find them it's even worse. And without enrolment the odds are slim. Existent, but slim. I won't stop looking though, a lot of people tend to just get some random stroke of luck and find the right sponsor for some reason, and I'm sure that'll happen sooner or later.
