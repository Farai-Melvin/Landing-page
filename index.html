        <p>A web developer</p>
        <p class="note">Yes, this is based off of one of my first projects, if you've had a look at my freeCodeCamp projects for some reason</p>
        <p class="note">I made this on the 14th of May 2025. It's 23:59 rn. I have omitted A LOT of information, which I'll update tomorrow. So stay tuned... or something. I'll try to make it clear that I've made edits when I do.</p>

      <h2>This is my Updates Website</h2>
      <p hidden>This website serves the purpose of presenting everything that has happened and will probably happen to me.
        It is in website format to showcase the Web dev skills I've acquired in the past 2 monthsâ€”just a way of me showing my dedication to Front-End Web Development and the fruits yielded from hours of errors, frustration and successes I've come cross whilst learning how to code.
        It will also be the first full scale project I'll be using later on and adding to part of my portfolio. There will be many errors and bugs (I hope not), but the plan is to reveal this only when I'm confident that the experience of whoever uses this will be ideal, worst case scenario it'll just be a basic website.
      </p>
      <p>Redacted</p>
      <p hidden>
        Please understand that the aim of this is mainly to have a fully functional website. 
        There WILL be flairs, but don't expect anything too extravagant.
        This was entirely coded using VS. VS is an IDE, not a library or framework. This means all of this is based off of code off my head. No apps, no AI, just straight up vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.

      <h2>Navigation</h2>
      <p>
        At the very top of this page there is a menu button. If you expand it it has different topics regarding my life.
        Use that to get to whichever bit you're currently interested in. It will probably be very lengthy, so bear with me. It IS an updates website after all.
